A simple NLP project that uses **BERT** to classify chat messages as **red flags** or **green flags** in conversations and relationships.  



##  Features
- Detects concerning (ðŸš© "red flag") statements in chat.  
- Beginner-friendly training and prediction scripts.  
- Uses a pretrained **BERT** model from Hugging Face.

## ðŸ›  How It Works
The system fine-tunes a pretrained **BERT** model on your labeled chat data.  
It learns to recognize patterns that signal either **red flags** (toxic/controlling/negative) or **green flags** (supportive/positive).
